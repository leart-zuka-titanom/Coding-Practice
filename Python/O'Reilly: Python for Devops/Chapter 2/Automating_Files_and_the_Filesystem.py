It is better to be in a virtual environment when downloading special packages, so you don't mess up certain dependencies especially on linux
In order to do that type:
    $python -m venv venv      //This creates a virtual environment with the name venv
    $source venv/bin/activate //This activates the virtual environment
Please for the love of god don't commit this folder to GitHub
